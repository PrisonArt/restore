    "description": "'I would like to share with you two simple truths: there is nothing that cannot be forgiven, and there is no one un-deserving of forgiveness' - Desmond Tutu.<br/> This contract is used to mint art created by incarcerated people, which is sold by our custom auction house contract, called Justice. The funds are split between accounts owned by the artist and by PRISON ART 501(c)3, an NPO based in Florida, who uses any funds raised to pay back the Legal Financial Obligations of the artist. These tokens therefore represent not just an aesthetic statement of inherent human dignity, but also a more wholesome economic narrative for returning citizens, and the restoration of justice in a society made rotten by the fact that it reincarcerates people simply for failure to pay debt they accumulated while in prison. These contracts represent an artful economic pattern for breaking such iniquitous cycles.",
