    "poem": "I worry that you will not welcome me,\nwill not know that you came from me.\nMarch-walking, I see you holding mommy's hand.\nThe first thing I notice is your hair,\nyou have a lot of it!\n\nIt is darker than I would have thought.\nThe photographs don't do its beauty justice, no.\nMy perfect treasure, I waited\nfor our reunion, shy of your first birthday\nand finally my heart breaks in the same room as yours.\nIt hurts that your touch is not immediate.\nWhen I get your squirmy toddler body in my arms\nyou're lighter than I imagined,\nyou are still small, my boy\n\nstill our baby, soft, wispy, clean,\nI love the texture of you,\nthe hairs on your head that feels like mine,\nfine to the touch, your chubby fingers\npick up fingernail-sized\nBits of chicken from\nmy vending machine salad.\nLater you smell of Enfamil and birthday cake,\nyour first tastes of chocolate (you seem pleased.)\nOutside the sun shines and that hair holds a golden halo\nover your baby black leather jacket, runny rose, diaper butt.\nI take notes of your smile, dribbling the basketball\nyou and me putting the soccer ball through the mini hoop\nthree feet high,\nI see you study me as I hide behind\nyour stuffed giraffe,\n\nyou seem to hold a gentle knowing\n\nthat you belong to me\n\nand that I belong to you\n\nand that we belong to mommy,\n\nand she belongs to us.\n\nI am relieved when your blue eyes\ngaze into my blue eyes\nand I can tell that you\nknow even\nbetter than I.",
